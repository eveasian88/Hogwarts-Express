## Hogwarts-Express

Cast your wish and let Hogwarts Express take you anywhere in the Muggle World! It accepts user input to add a new train line, start time and frequency to the schedule time table. It displays the schedule with next arrival based on the current time and frequency of train stops. It stores the train information in Firebase for data persistence and retrieves information from the database on load. However, for those who have solemnly sworn to be up to no good, you can delete any train line from the schedule and database with the click of a button so you can't be tracked by the Dark Lord and his followers. Evanesco!
